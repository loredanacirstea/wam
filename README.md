# wam: WebAssembly Macro language and processor

## wam syntax

Wam syntax is a near superset of wat syntax that is more convenient
for human developers to write directly.

The one place where wam is not a strict superset of wat
is that it does not supports numeric indexes for globals, functions,
and local references. But this is okay because index based references
are much less useful to humans than they are to computers.

The following extensions to the wat syntax are supported:

- The `call` operation can be omitted if the function is specified by
  name.
- i32 and f32 constants can be specified directly without wrapping
  with `i32.const` or `f32.const`. Floating point literals must
  include a decimal point.
- Local variables can be specified directly without wrapping with
  `local.get`.
- Static strings can be specified inline. All static strings in the
  code will be de-duplicated, they will be added to a global data
  section, pointer variables will be created that index into the data
  section and the original static inline string will be replaced with
  a lookup relative to `$memoryBase`.
- `AND` and `OR` macros that implement i32 boolean logic operations
  which support 1 or more conditions and that are short-circuiting.
- `STATIC_ARRAY` macro that allocates the specified number of bytes as
  a static array in the data section. Note this creates an static
  global array in the `data` section at build time not at runtime
  (i.e. it does not dynamically allocate memory). `STATIC_ARRAY`
  takes an optional second argument that specifies the byte alignment.
  The default alignment is 1 (e.g. unaligned).
- `CHR` macro that converts a 1 byte string into a character (i.e.
  `i32.const`) value.
- `LET` macro that combines functionality from `locals` and
  `local.set` into a single construct that allow more concise
  declaration and initialization of i32 values.

## wamp: wam processor

Current functionality:

- Processes wam syntax into standard wat syntax support.
- Automatically adds `memory` and `memoryBase` definitions if they
  aren't already defined or imported. Memory size defaults to 256 but
  can be changed via `--memorySize` command line parameter.
- Supports combining multiple modules into a single module.
- Retains whitespace and comments from original wam file(s).
- Implemented as a small JavaScript/Node program that can be fairly
  easy extended with additional macro definitions.

Future functionality:

- Support user-defined `(data ...)` sections. You can currently
  accomplish approximately the same thing with the `STATIC_ARRAY` or
  `STRING` macros in your code.
- Add an elif construct (complex conditionals currently are become
  highly indented and hard to read)
- Allow bare names for global variables in addition to locals by
  implementing some limited lexical scope.
- Proper resolving/linking/checking of imports and exports when
  multiple files are specified.


## Example

In the `examples/` directory is a fizzbuzz example that makes use of
wam syntax. Use `wamp` to convert the example to wat source.

```
./wamp examples/fizzbuzz.wam examples/print.wam > fizzbuzz.wat
```

Examine the wam files and the resulting wat to see what processing
and macro expansion was performanced by `wamp`. The wat source can be
compiled to a wasm module using the `wasm-as` assembler from
[binaryen](https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen).

```
wasm-as fizzbuzz.wat -o fizzbuzz.wasm
```

The wasm module can be executed using the
[wac/wace](https://github.com/kanaka/wac) WebAssembly interpreter:

```
wace ./fizzbuzz.wasm
```
